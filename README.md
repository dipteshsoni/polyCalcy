hectic task so easy that it is mesmerising when used once.

The program is written in c++ language which is one of the fastest language considered. 
A lot of algorithms have been used here but don't get afraid by the lines of code, this program is written in a very optimised way . It 
will give output in minimum execution time possible. 

The best thing about this program is that It is written in a clean manner that means it is easy to maintain and the concepts of object oriented 
programming makes it best and different from other ways of writing the code .
Also a lot of thing will be getting updated regularly . currently it serves the purpose for
